# bash-learner
This c program teaches you how to use the bash command line interface. I recommend to use a linux distro or macos.

Clone the repository by writing this in the console

```
git clone https://github.com/RazerSAISO/bash_learner.git
```
then compile the code:

```
cd bash-le
gcc bash-learner.c -o bashlearner
```
then run:
```
./bashlearner
```

if there git is not installed install it:
In debian based system:
```
sudo apt install update
sudo apt install upgrade
sudo apt install git
```
In red hat:
```
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum install git
```
In Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install git`
```
or 
```
sudo yum install git
```
In MacOSX:
```
