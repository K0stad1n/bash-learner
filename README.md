This c program teaches you how to use the bash command line interface. I recommend to use a linux distro or macos.

Clone the repository by writing this in the console

```
git clone https://github.com/RazerSAISO/bash_learner.git
```
then compile the code:

```
cd bash_learner
make
```
If you are in linux to run just write:
```
bash-learner
```
If you are on MacOS to run use:
```
bash-learner
```
if there git is not installed install it:
In debian based system:
```
sudo apt install update
sudo apt install upgrade
sudo apt install git
```
In red hat:
```
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum install git
```
In Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install git
```
or 
```
sudo yum install git
```
In MacOSX:
```
xcode-select --install
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew install git
```
To uninstall:
```
make uninstall
```
