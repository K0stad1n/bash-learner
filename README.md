# bash-learner

![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/K0stad1n/bash_learner/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

This C program teaches you how to use the bash command line interface. I recommend to use a linux distro or macos.

Clone the repository by writing this in the console

```
git clone https://github.com/K0stad1n/bash_learner.git
```
then compile the code:

```
cd bash_learner
make
```
To run the program:
```
bash-learner
```
if git is not installed install it:

In debian based system:
```
sudo apt install update
sudo apt install upgrade
sudo apt install git
```
In red hat:
```
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum install git
```
In Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install git
```
or 
```
sudo yum install git
```
In macos:
```
xcode-select --install
```
To uninstall:
```
make uninstall
```
To update:
```
make update
```
